# Agent Draft for Issue #4

Original issue: https://github.com/SydFloyd/KaolCode/issues/4

# Implementation Notes

## Summary
Performed a live end-to-end test for the Agent after the patch diff handling fix related to git add -N. Verified behavior based on issue #4.

## Changes

- Pulled latest code with patch resolving git add -N diff issues.
- Executed live Agent workflow covering file modifications, staged (with -N), and patch generation.
- Observed diff, patch, and commit stages to confirm correct behavior post-fix.
- Updated tests/documentation if discrepancies found during live run.

## Validation

- All patched areas confirmed to handle partial file staging correctly.
- Live test produced diffs and patches as expected, matching actual file changes.
- No errors encountered; regression checks for previous edge cases passed.
- Noted timestamp of this validation: 2026-02-17T18:39:50.
