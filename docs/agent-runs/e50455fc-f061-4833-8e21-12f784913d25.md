# Implementation Notes

## Summary
Implement a smoke test for the CLI intake helper script to verify its end-to-end functionality.

## Changes
- Add a new test script, e.g., tests/smoke/test_cli_helper.py.
- Script will invoke the CLI intake helper with sample input (using subprocess or similar).
- Check that the CLI runs successfully (zero exit status) and produces the expected output or side effects (e.g., file created, terminal output).

## Validation
- Ensure the smoke test is executed (manually or as part of CI).
- Confirm test passes under typical environments.
- Validate output/artifacts match expectations for the given sample input.
- Check for no unexpected exceptions or errors in the CLI run.
