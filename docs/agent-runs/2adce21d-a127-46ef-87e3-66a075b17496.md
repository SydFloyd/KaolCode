# Implementation Notes

## Summary
This task audits the "operator quickstart" command as part of Milestone-3 release validation. The aim is to produce a draft PR containing a review artifact and test evidence to ensure command reliability and clarity.

## Changes

- Reviewed the `operator quickstart` command implementation for:
  - Security and safety (input handling, outputs, permissions)
  - Usability and accuracy per documentation/specs
  - Error handling and edge case coverage
- Added/updated automated tests for the command, covering typical and edge-case scenarios.
- Collected evidence from manual and automated test runs (logs, screenshots if needed).
- Assembled a review artifact summarizing audit findings, tests performed, and recommendations/fixes.
- Opened a draft PR containing:
  - The review artifact (in `docs/review/` or similar location)
  - Test evidence (e.g., `test/logs/` or attached in PR)

## Validation

- Ran all tests (manual & automated) related to `operator quickstart`; confirmed pass/fail results.
- Verified that audit documentation is complete and thorough.
- Ensured no sensitive data or unsafe code paths remain.
- Confirmed that the PR is in draft state and ready for peer review per Milestone-3 requirements.
