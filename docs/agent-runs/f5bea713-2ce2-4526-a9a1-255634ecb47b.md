# Implementation Notes: Canary Rollout Risks & Rollback Plan

## Summary

Add an operational note outlining the risks, rollback steps, and a validation checklist for canary deployments in the SydFloyd/KaolCode repository. This aims to support reliable feature rollouts with clear mitigation and recovery guidelines.

## Changes

- Create a new `docs/canary-operational-note.md` file.
- Document:
  - **Purpose**: Brief overview of canary deployments for KaolCode.
  - **Rollout Risks**: Concise risk bullet points (e.g., partial failures, config drift, performance regressions).
  - **Rollback Plan**: Step-by-step instructions for reverting to a stable release.
  - **Validation Checklist**: Key post-deployment checks (e.g., health metrics, error logs, user canary group feedback).
- Link document from the main `README.md` or an existing deployment docs section.

## Validation

- [ ] Document includes summary, risks, rollback, and validation checklist sections.
- [ ] Contents are accurate and relevant to KaolCode deployment workflows.
- [ ] Document is accessible at `docs/canary-operational-note.md`.
- [ ] Linked from README or main operational docs.
- [ ] Markdown formatting is valid and readable.
