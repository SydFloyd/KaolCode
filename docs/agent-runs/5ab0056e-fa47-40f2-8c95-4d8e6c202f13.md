# Agent Draft for Issue #1

Original issue: https://github.com/SydFloyd/KaolCode/issues/1

# Implementation Notes

## Summary
Implement a real path smoke test for the agent's checkout/branch/push/draft-PR workflow. This test should validate the full end-to-end flow from a local orchestrator, as described in issue #1.

## Changes

- Add a new automated test script to simulate:
  - Checking out the repository.
  - Creating a new branch.
  - Pushing changes.
  - Opening a draft pull request.
- Integrate the test into the local orchestrator execution flow.
- Ensure logging and error reporting for each step.
- Time-stamp the test as required: 2026-02-17T18:35:20.
- Update documentation (if necessary) to reflect the smoke test.

## Validation

- Run the smoke test locally, ensuring each step (checkout, branch, push, draft PR) completes successfully without manual intervention.
- Verify the resulting draft PR is created in the repository.
- Confirm logs and results are captured for troubleshooting and future test runs.
- Document success/failure with screenshots or console output and reference the relevant commit/PR numbers.
