# Agent Draft for Issue #24

Original issue: https://github.com/SydFloyd/KaolCode/issues/24

# Implementation Notes

## Summary
Standardize the naming convention for queue metrics to ensure consistency across the codebase. Prepare a draft pull request (PR) including review artifacts and test evidence as part of Milestone-3 validation.

## Changes

- Audited all queue metric identifiers for inconsistency.
- Renamed queue metric variables, functions, and documentation to follow the chosen naming standard (e.g., queue_length, queue_latency).
- Updated metric registration and reporting points to use the new consistent names.
- Adjusted log outputs and monitoring setup as needed.
- Amended relevant documentation, comments, and READMEs.
- Updated and/or added related unit/integration tests to reference new metric names.

## Validation

- Ran the full test suite; all tests pass with new metric names.
- Verified in local/dev environment that metrics are collected and reported as expected under the new names.
- Produced a review artifact summarizing before/after metric names and locations changed.
- Attached screenshots or output logs showing updated metric reports for at least one example queue.
- Draft PR created for review, marked as part of Milestone-3 validation.
