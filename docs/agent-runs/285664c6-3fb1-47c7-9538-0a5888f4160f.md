# Agent Draft for Issue #4

Original issue: https://github.com/SydFloyd/KaolCode/issues/4

# Implementation Notes

## Summary

Performed a live end-to-end agent test after patching the handling of git add -N patch diffs. This ensures the system properly accounts for staged file intent and accurately applies subsequent operations.

## Changes

- Ran full live agent workflow using updated patch diff logic.
- Verified git add -N now correctly stages intent-to-add with accurate diff output.
- Inspected logs and outcomes for regressions or edge case failures tied to patch handling after the fix.

## Validation

- All agent steps completed successfully without error.
- Diff and patch application matched expectations with intended new files and modifications.
- Confirmed that previously reported issue is resolved; no unexpected file states or data loss.
- Manually checked repository state before, during, and after the test session.
