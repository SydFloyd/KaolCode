# Agent Draft for Issue #8

Original issue: https://github.com/SydFloyd/KaolCode/issues/8

# Implementation Notes

## Summary
Implement a test to ensure that the text intake process does **not** automatically apply the agent-ready label, thereby preventing duplicate webhook jobs. This addresses issue #8 to ensure label deduplication in text intake.

## Changes
- Add a new test case under the relevant text intake test suite (e.g., `tests/intake/test_text_intake.py`).
- Simulate text intake event with conditions that previously triggered agent-ready label application.
- Assert that:
  - agent-ready label is **not** applied during the text intake process.
  - No duplicate webhook jobs are queued as a result.

## Validation
- Run the new and existing tests:  
  `pytest tests/intake/test_text_intake.py`
- Confirm that:
  - The test passes, verifying correct label handling.
  - No unexpected labels or duplicate jobs triggered in logs/test output.
- (Optional) Manually monitor webhook job queue during a text intake to ensure no duplicates.
