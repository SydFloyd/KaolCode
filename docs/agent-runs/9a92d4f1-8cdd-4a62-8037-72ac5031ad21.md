# Agent Draft for Issue #19

Original issue: https://github.com/SydFloyd/KaolCode/issues/19

# Implementation Notes

## Summary
Implement a smoke test that validates the "fast-mode" intake functionality in the project, ensuring it works as expected, but without writing to or interacting with GitHub Issues.

## Changes

- **Test Added:**  
  - Created a new automated test (smoke test) for the fast-mode intake feature.
- **Test Behavior:**  
  - Executes the fast-mode intake.
  - Asserts expected outputs or state changes internally, not involving external systems (e.g., no GitHub Issue API calls).
- **Test Location:**  
  - Placed within the appropriate test suite (e.g., `tests/` directory), named to indicate it is a smoke test for fast-mode.
- **No External Writes:**  
  - Mocked/stubbed or bypassed any code that would attempt to write to GitHub Issues to ensure test purity.

## Validation

- **Smoke Test Passes:**  
  - Run the test suite and confirm the new fast-mode smoke test passes.
- **No Side Effects:**  
  - Verified that no GitHub Issues are created or modified during the test.
- **Review:**  
  - Double-checked logs and code paths to ensure all external write operations are mocked or disabled in the test context.
- **CI/CD:**  
  - Confirmed tests pass in CI to ensure reproducibility.
