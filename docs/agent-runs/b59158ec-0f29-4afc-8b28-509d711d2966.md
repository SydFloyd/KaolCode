# Agent Draft for Issue #8

Original issue: https://github.com/SydFloyd/KaolCode/issues/8

## Summary

Implement a test to ensure that the text intake process does not forcibly assign the agent-ready label. This is to prevent creating duplicate webhook jobs in the system.

## Changes

- Add a test case in the deduplication test suite for the text intake workflow.
- Simulate text input without the agent-ready label.
- Verify that the agent-ready label is not set automatically during intake.
- Check that webhook job deduplication is functioning as expected (no duplicates triggered).

## Validation

- All existing and new tests in the deduplication suite pass.
- Confirm, via test assertions or logs, that no duplicate webhook jobs are created by the text intake process.
- Manually test, if necessary, by submitting similar text inputs and observing webhook job creation and label state.
