# Agent Draft for Issue #21

Original issue: https://github.com/SydFloyd/KaolCode/issues/21

# Implementation Notes

## Summary

Implement a controlled canary to test and validate the full release lane workflow: creating an issue, triggering the job, and opening a draft pull request (PR) in release mode. The goal is to ensure the "issue → job → draft PR" flow functions as expected for the release lane with release:canary.

## Changes

- Add a canary control flag or configuration for the release lane.
- Enhance automation/scripts to initiate the release lane from an issue with the canary flag.
- Ensure the job is correctly triggered by the issue and uses release:canary settings.
- Modify or verify the workflow that creates a draft PR as the final step.
- Add specific logging/outputs to aid monitoring of the test run.
- (Optionally) Create test data (e.g., a specific canary issue template or label) to prevent confusion with production releases.

## Validation

- Create a canary-tagged issue to initiate the workflow.
- Confirm that the corresponding job starts automatically.
- Verify that a draft PR is generated with the expected content and in draft status.
- Check that all automated outputs, logs, and status markers indicate a successful pass of the "issue → job → draft PR" path.
- Ensure the canary run does not inadvertently trigger full release behaviors or side effects.
