# Agent Draft for Issue #23

Original issue: https://github.com/SydFloyd/KaolCode/issues/23

# Implementation Notes

## Summary
This task involves conducting a documentation hygiene pass on dependency-related files as part of the Milestone-3 validation for the SydFloyd/KaolCode repository. The goal is to ensure accuracy, clarity, and completeness in documentation about dependencies, and to produce a draft PR with review evidence and validation artifacts.

## Changes

- Audit the following for dependency documentation:
  - `README.md` (dependency installation and usage)
  - `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` (as applicable)
  - Any `docs/` files referring to dependencies or environment setup
- Fix outdated, missing, or unclear references to dependencies:
  - Ensure prerequisite instructions match specification files
  - Cross-check documented and actual dependencies
  - Update/clarify version requirements when necessary
  - Standardize formatting (lists, links, code blocks)
- Add/ensure a CHANGELOG entry for doc updates
- Optionally add badges for dependency status (e.g., dependabot, requires.io)
- Prepare a draft PR including:
  - Reference to Issue #23 and Milestone-3
  - Summary of changes
  - Screenshot(s) or rendered previews

## Validation

- Review all dependency docs for accuracy and clarity
- Run dependency installation steps on a clean environment to confirm reproducibility
- Capture terminal logs as test evidence
- Attach diff output and before/after screenshots/previews to PR as a review artifact
- Confirm PR builds without doc-related errors in CI/CD
