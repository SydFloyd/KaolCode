# Agent Live Test after Patch Diff Fix

**Repository:** SydFloyd/KaolCode  
**Issue:** #4  
**Title:** Agent live test after patch diff fix

---

## Summary

After implementing a fix for handling git add -N patch diffs, perform a live end-to-end test to verify that the agent operates correctly with the new diff processing logic.

---

## Changes

- Deployed the patch diff handling fix involving git add -N.  
- Ran the agent through the complete end-to-end workflow that previously triggered diff issues.
- Monitored agent logs and outputs for any diff interpretation errors.

---

## Validation

- Confirmed that the agent correctly processes and applies patch diffs produced by git add -N.
- Verified expected state/changelist after agent operations matches intended file modifications.
- Saw no diff-related exceptions or regressions in the agent live test logs.
- Timestamped the test execution: 2026-02-17T18:39:50.
