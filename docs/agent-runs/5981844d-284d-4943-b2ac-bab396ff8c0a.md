# Agent Draft for Issue #3

Original issue: https://github.com/SydFloyd/KaolCode/issues/3

# Implementation Notes

## Summary
This update addresses issue #3 by retrying the agent's live clone, push, and draft-PR workflow after a fix to the Git authentication header. The goal is to verify that authentication issues are resolved and that the end-to-end process works as expected.

## Changes
- Re-ran the live test covering:
  - Repository clone
  - Commit and push
  - Creating a draft pull request
- Ensured the authentication header fix is included/applied before retry
- Updated test documentation/timestamps where necessary
- Monitored for and noted any new errors or successful completion

## Validation
- Confirmed clone, push, and PR creation complete without authentication errors
- Checked logs for any new failures or warnings
- Verified the draft PR appears in the target repository (SydFloyd/KaolCode)
- Documented outcomes and any necessary follow-ups for future debugging
